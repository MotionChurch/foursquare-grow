        <h1>New Believers</h1>
        <p>
            CONGRATULATIONS on your new relationship with Jesus Christ.
            It is vital to grow in your understanding of God and of Jesus
            Christ and the Holy Spirit as you begin your new journey of
            faith in Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may not feel a sense of urgency to begin, to get the full
            understanding of your &ldquo;new birth&rdquo; as the Bible
            calls it.  But trust us when we tell you that to delay in your
            growing in the knowledge of Jesus and His life for you, will
            only hinder you as a follower of Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
            The SEEKER series of four videos you are about to watch
            provides you with very important foundational elements of
            God's love for you and his gift of salvation through Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
            Watch them in their entirety!  The last video will lead in a
            prayer of salvation that you have already done at church.  You
            are free to pray it again, but it is not necessary, you are
            SAVED!
