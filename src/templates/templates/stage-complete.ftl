        <h1>Congratulations!</h1>

        <p>
            Congratulations on the completion of the ${stage?cap_first} level of the GROW process.
        </p>

        <p>
            We strongly encourage you move to the next stage of GROW.  However,
            before you do that, let’s review a key component to ensure you
            experience the transformation and benefits of what you have already
            learned:  Implementation.
        </p>

        <p>
            Learning is important, we should all be continuous learners,
            otherwise we stagnate.
        </p>

        <p>
            However to learn new information and then not implement or employ
            that learning in our life, will make us smarter but not necessarily
            wiser or better.
        </p>

        <p>
            For many there is a “knowing, doing gap” in their lives. They know
            a lot, but they don’t do anything with what they know, and they remain
            “stuck”.
        </p>

        <p>
            We know that for your new knowledge and learning to have an impact
            on your life you must implement it.
        </p>

        <p>
            You were given some tips for how to act on the new knowledge you
            have. We encourage you to be proactive and intentional in closing the
            gap between what you know and what you do, to experience all that God
            has for you.
        </p>
