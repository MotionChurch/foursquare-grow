        <p>
            Upon completion of the assessment, you will be invited to join the
            process at the appropriate stage.  For example if the assessment
            returns a “believer” result, you will be invited to start the
            Believer level of this process.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once you have completed this level, you will be invited to begin the next stage of GROW.
